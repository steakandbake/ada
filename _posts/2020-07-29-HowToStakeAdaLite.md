## Staking with Ledger Nano S/X and AdaLite.io

Since the dawn of Cardano entering the the Shelley era, you can now delegate your ADA coins to a stake pool. This is known as staking where you earn new ADA as staking rewards. This guide is primarily for ada holders who wish to delegate their ada to a stake pool, but are not sure about where to start.

### Update with Ledger Live

				<tr>
					<td>1) Connect your Ledger Nano, enter PIN and open Ledger Live</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2) Click Manager and then upgrade your firmware to version 1.6 or greater.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3) Update the Cardano ADA app to version 2.0.3 or greater.</td>

			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>
</section>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5) On your Ledger wallet, confirm exporting the public key. This happens twice and needs two clicks.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6) If you previously had ADA before Shelley, you need to convert your balance to a Shelley Wallet. Click "Convert to stakable". Next, review and click "Confirm Transaction" and confirm transaction on your Ledger Nano.</td>
				</tr>				
				<tr>
					<td>7) With a stakable balance, you can now choose a stake pool.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>8) In the <b>Delegate Section</b>, copy and paste the pool ID you would like to delegate to.<br><br>

We would love to earn your delegation.<br><br>
Our pool ID is <code>f76e3a1104a9d816a67d5826a155c9e2979a839d0d944346d47e33ab</code>

<h3>Nice Steak!</h3>
<blockquote>Now you're now staking ADA. You're set to earn rewards every 5 days. First payout should arrive in about 16 days. HAPPY STEAKING! </blockquote>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
* Staked funds always remain in your possession. You are not sending funds away.
* You are free to move funds anytime. There is no lock up period.
* Delegating requires a 2 ADA deposit. You get back your deposit when you undelegate your stake.
* Staking does not require you to leave any wallets open. Feel free to close.
* You can check the progress of your rewards every epoch or 5 days.
* Rewards multiply with the power of compounding.
* If you add more ADA to your account, the new ADA is automatically delegated. No need to re-delegate!
