## Staking with Yoroi Wallet works with Trezor Model T and Ledger Nano S|X

Since the dawn of Cardano's Shelley era, you can delegate your ADA coins to a stake pool. This is known as staking where you earn new ADA as staking rewards. This guide is primarily for ada holders who wish to delegate their ada to a stake pool, but are not sure about where to start.

### I'm using a Trezor Model T, I will update my firmware.

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2) The website will prompt you to upgrade your firmware to <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-for-trezor-model-t-version-2-3-2-and-trezor-model-one-version-1-9-2-f4f9c0f1ed7c">version 2.3.2</a> or greater.</td>

<h3>Nice Steak!</h3>
<blockquote>Now you're staking ADA. You're set to earn rewards every 5 days. First payout should arrive in about 15-20 days. HAPPY STEAKING! </blockquote>

------------

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
* Staked funds always remain in your possession. You are not sending funds away.
* You are free to move funds anytime. There is no lock up period.
* Delegating requires a 2 ADA deposit. You get back your deposit when you undelegate your stake.
* Staking does not require you to leave any wallets open. Feel free to close.
* You can check the progress of your rewards every epoch or 5 days.
* Rewards multiply with the power of compounding.
* If you add more ADA to your account, the new ADA is automatically delegated. No need to re-delegate!
* A minimum of 10 ADA is required to start a delegation.
