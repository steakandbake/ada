## Staking with Trezor Model T and AdaLite.io

Since the dawn of Cardano's Shelley era, you can delegate your ADA coins to a stake pool. This is known as staking where you earn new ADA as staking rewards. This guide is primarily for ada holders who wish to delegate their ada to a stake pool, but are not sure about where to start.

<h3>Nice Steak!</h3>
<blockquote>Now you're staking ADA. You're set to earn rewards every 5 days. First payout should arrive in about 15-20 days. HAPPY STEAKING! </blockquote>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
* Staked funds always remain in your possession. You are not sending funds away.
* You are free to move funds anytime. There is no lock up period.
* Delegating requires a 2 ADA deposit. You get back your deposit when you undelegate your stake.
* Staking does not require you to leave any wallets open. Feel free to close.
* You can check the progress of your rewards every epoch or 5 days.
* Rewards multiply with the power of compounding.
* If you add more ADA to your account, the new ADA is automatically delegated. No need to re-delegate!
* A minimum of 10 ADA is required to start a delegation.
